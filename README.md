## Project Goals

- Create UI for a customizable card game
  - Cards for main player
  - Cards for opponents
  - Table
  - Organizing cards and other objects in to component files

## Contributors 

1. Start by going to a new directory on your machine and running `git clone https://github.com/BranchPandas/card-deck-ui.git; git clone https://github.com/BranchPandas/card-deck-ui.wiki.git`
   1. This will create two local git repos for this project, one for the codebase and another for this Wiki.
   2. Contribute to both!
2. Run `cd card-deck-ui; npm install;`
   1. This will move to the correct directory and install packages for this project (See `package.json`)
3. Spin up the project locally by running `npm run dev`
   1. This is a special command in `package.json` scripts.
   2. This command uses a package called concurrently to spin up multiple services in a single terminal
      1. (Without it, you would have to open a new terminal for each and run the commands separately)
